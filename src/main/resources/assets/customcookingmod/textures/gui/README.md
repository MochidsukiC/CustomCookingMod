# AI Kitchen GUI Texture

This directory should contain the GUI texture for the AI Kitchen interface.

## Required File
- `ai_kitchen.png` - 176x166 pixels PNG image

## Texture Layout
The texture should be a standard Minecraft GUI background with:
- Dimensions: 176 pixels wide x 166 pixels tall
- Standard inventory slots area at the bottom (84 pixels from bottom)
- Top area for custom GUI elements (recipe generation interface)
- Background should match Minecraft's default GUI style

## Notes
- The texture file `ai_kitchen.png` needs to be created by a graphic designer or you can use existing Minecraft GUI textures as a template
- For now, the game will use the default GUI rendering if this texture is missing
- You can find Minecraft GUI texture templates online or extract them from the vanilla game
